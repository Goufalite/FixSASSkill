# FixSASSkill

**WARNING** : this mod overrides completely how SAS works in the game by using the strict rule found in career with kerbal XP activated (before 1.11.1). If you don’t like the behavior of this mod, just uninstall it or fork it with your own algorithm.

This mod fixes the "why can my 1-star pilot completely SAS", "since when Bob can SAS?" or "wait, stayputnik can full SAS now?" bug introduced in 1.11.1. [More info](https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specialization#No_experience_specialization_override).

* Only **PILOTS** can SAS
* Probes can SAS and the "Probes can full SAS" setting is taken in account.
* The higher Pilot/Probe SAS level is taken in account.
* **No more gamemode/kerbal XP dependency**

## Dependencies :
